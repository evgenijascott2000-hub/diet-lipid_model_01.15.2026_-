SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS REPORT
Dietary Variable Encoding Methods Comparison
================================================================================

Test Lipid: log(Triglycerides)
Number of variables tested: 0

ENCODING METHODS COMPARED:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Method 1: Original Categorical (0-5)
  - 0=Never, 1=<1/week, 2=1/week, 3=2-4/week, 4=5-6/week, 5=Daily
  - Assumes equal spacing between categories

Method 2: Weekly Frequency (0.0-7.0 times/week)
  - 0=0.0, 1=0.5, 2=1.0, 3=3.0, 4=5.5, 5=7.0
  - More realistic frequency estimates

Method 3: Dummy Variables (One-Hot)
  - Each category becomes a binary indicator
  - No ordering assumptions
  - Not tested extensively (high dimensionality)


================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For publication, we recommend:
1. Use Method 2 (weekly frequency) as primary analysis
2. Report Method 1 results in supplementary materials
3. State explicitly that results are consistent across methods
4. Acknowledge the equal-spacing assumption in limitations
